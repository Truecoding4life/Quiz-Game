### Development Process



Throughout this project I learned that using comment on js or HTML is very useful when it come to project this complexity. I have only been coding for 2 weeks and I have grown from this project with all the walls that I ran into. Doing pseudo code really with what is the next step to solve the problem.

Pseudo code:
1. Have a button, when clicked ->
    * Game start
        * Display question
            if the answer is correct move to next question
            else subtract the clock by # of time
        * After answer the question another question appears
    * Timer Start
        * When the timer reach 0
            * if all question is answer == win 
            * else == game is over
2. When the game is over
    * I can save my initial + score:
